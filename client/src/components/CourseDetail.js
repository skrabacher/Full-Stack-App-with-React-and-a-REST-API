//Stateful Class Component
// This component provides the "Course Detail" screen by retrieving the detail for a course from the REST API's /api/courses/:id route and rendering the course. The component also renders a "Delete Course" button that when clicked should send a DELETE request to the REST API's /api/courses/:id route in order to delete a course. This component also renders an "Update Course" button for navigating to the "Update Course" screen.

//retrieves data from the REST API



//Pro Tip: Resist the temptation to keep and manage the courses data as global state in the App component. Instead, allow the Courses and CourseDetail components to retrieve their data from the REST API when those components are mounted. Using this approach simplifies the management of the courses data and ensures that the data won't get out of sync with the REST API's persisted data.
